# Grammar Parser
This is a coffeescript application which parses a grammar in BNF format
and can produce coffeescript code which contains actions and goto tables
used to parse any language.

It can also be used on editors to format BNF code, analyze grammars,
transform them between different formats (xml, json, bnf...), etc.
